<h1>Ah, Shoot (3/19/18)</h1>
<p>
My company shot a music video this last weekend. We were planning the shoot to take just 5 hours. 6:00PM to 11:00PM (give or take). It took double that time. I didn’t get back till 6:00am.
It didn’t feel great. I’m sore and dead tired, as the rest of my partners are. We were wrong in our time estimates. Out of all the things to go wrong, I’d pick working overtime any day instead of a broken generator or camera.

<h1>1st thought (3/13/18)</h1>
<p>
Well I did it, I made a place to write. If you can't tell already, I don't like the word "blog." I feel like I'd have to monetize something if I called this a blog, or look at read numbers or something. Anyways, here we are. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to get this far. look how far we've come. I'm writing in my text editor so I'm not even spel cheekign.

I decided to make this, this morning, I created a task in Todoist ( the current to do system I use). I've been trying to follow through with tasks I set and this is one of them. Before this, I checked off the task of getting root remover for my sewer lat. Long story. In conclusion my goal here is to keep things basic here. I'm trying to do a lot of things.
