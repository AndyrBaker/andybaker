<h1>Test (3/24/18)</h1>
<p>It’s been a week or two since I set the task to make this area in which I write. ( still avoiding the word blog). I’ve learned a lot since then. First, setting a reminder to write (Every Thursday) proves to be very useful. Secondly I forgot how hard it is to write. Formulating thoughts from head to page, no matter how clear they are in my head, is an excellent exercise.</p>

<p>It’s amazing how little we test our day to day living. When was the last time you tested all the lights on your car? Or checked for leaks in your attic when it’s raining. We often ignore the preventive maintenance and eventually have to pay for the repair, which is often quite a lot more.</p> 

<p>Often the excuse is how little time we have which I have trouble accepting. For instance, I inspect my cars once a week ( admittedly I don’t check each bulb every time) but I do clean them out, check tires, and so forth. On average it takes me about 10-15 min a week to do this. In contrast I know by experience that if the goal is to keep the car as clean as possible, cleaning the car once a month makes the task exponentially harder, and we don’t even have kids yet. Often with those intervals, the wear causes more permanent blemishes, along with visibility issues such as dirty headlights and windows.</p>

<p>How does this translate to writing? I may have everything sorted out in my head but how does it translate into paper. Do I have a leak or a burned out bulb in my head and not realize it? Writing everything out on paper is a great way to test what you think you have in your head. </p>
 
<h1>Ah, Shoot (3/19/18)</h1>
<p>
My company shot a music video this last weekend. We were planning the shoot to take just 5 hours. 6:00PM to 11:00PM (give or take). It took double that time. I didn’t get back till 6:00am.
It didn’t feel great. I’m sore and dead tired, as the rest of my partners are. We were wrong in our time estimates. Out of all the things to go wrong, I’d pick working overtime any day instead of a broken generator or camera.

<h1>1st thought (3/13/18)</h1>
<p>
Well I did it, I made a place to write. If you can't tell already, I don't like the word "blog." I feel like I'd have to monetize something if I called this a blog, or look at read numbers or something. Anyways, here we are. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to get this far. look how far we've come. I'm writing in my text editor so I'm not even spel cheekign.
</p> 
<p>
I decided to make this, this morning, I created a task in Todoist ( the current to do system I use). I've been trying to follow through with tasks I set and this is one of them. Before this, I checked off the task of getting root remover for my sewer lat. Long story. In conclusion my goal here is to keep things basic here. I'm trying to do a lot of things.
