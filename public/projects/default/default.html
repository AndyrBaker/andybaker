	Well I did it, I made a place to write. If you can't tell already, I don't like the word "blog." I feel like I'd have to monetize something if I called this a blog, or look at read numbers or something. Anyways, here we are. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to get this far. look how far we've come. I'm writing in my text editor so I'm not even spel cheekign.

	I decided to make this, this morning, I created a task in Todoist ( the current to do system I use). I've been trying to follow through with tasks I set and this is one of them. Before this, I checked off the task of getting root remover for my sewer lat. Long story. In conclusion my goal here is to keep things basic here. I'm trying to do a lot of things.
